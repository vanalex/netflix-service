# Netflix Clone Backend (Rust + Axum)

This is a high-performance REST API built with **Rust** and **Axum 0.8**. It serves as the backend for a Netflix Clone frontend, handling data fetching from TMDB (The Movie Database) and local video streaming.

## 🚀 Features

* **Blazingly Fast:** Built on Rust and Tokio.
* **Modular Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns (Handlers, Models, State).
* **TMDB Integration:** Fetches Trending Movies, Search Results (Movies/TV), and Trailers.
* **Video Streaming:** Supports HTTP Range Requests (Status 206) for smooth video playback.
* **CORS Enabled:** Configured to work with React/Vite frontends.

Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory. This file is mandatory to configure the API keys and server settings.

```env
touch .env
```

Open the .env file and paste the following configuration:
```env
TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
HOST=127.0.0.1
PORT=8080
```

Important Notes:

TMDB_API_KEY: You can get a free key at themoviedb.org.

PORT: We use 8080 to avoid conflicts with the React Frontend (which typically runs on port 3000).

Setup Streaming Assets
```
mkdir assets
```

Download a sample video file (e.g., video.mp4) and place it in the assets/ directory.

Start the server in development mode:

Bash
```
cargo run
```
You should see the following output indicating the server is active:

```
...
Server listening on [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)
```
